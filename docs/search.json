I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at PES University.\nThis spring, I interned at Schneider Electric as an R&D Intern in the Secure Power team where I worked on research for cloud architecture models and the migration of monolithic legacy code to microservices architecture. In the previous summers, I’ve spent my time alternating between interning at startups and researching under my university labs.\nMy research interests are broadly efficieny and sustainability in cloud computing. I’ve worked on various projects; you can find a list of my publications here and my resume here."

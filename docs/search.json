It describes the interactions between external entities (such as users or other systems) and the system to achieve a specific goal. Use case diagrams, which often accompany this modeling, visually represent these interactions using actors, use cases (actions performed by the system), and the relationships between them. This process helps guide the system design and development phases in Java applications by ensuring a clear understanding of user needs and system behaviors.\n\nProblem statement and solution for use case modeling can be found here."

It provides flexibility by enabling different ways to call the same method depending on the argument types.\n\nThe problem statement for method overloading in java can be found here.\n\n\n\nConstructor Overloading\nConstructor overloading allows a class to have more than one constructor, each with different parameters. This lets you create objects with different initializations based on the parameters provided when calling the constructor.\n\nThe problem statement for constructor overloading in java can be found here.\n\n\n\nAggregation and Composition\n\nComposition: Composition is a design principle where one class contains objects of another class, indicating a “has-a” relationship. In Java, the lifetime of the composed object is bound to the lifetime of the containing object, meaning the contained object cannot exist independently.\nAggregation: Aggregation is a “has-a” relationship where one class contains a reference to objects of another class, but the contained objects can exist independently. In Java, aggregation represents a weaker relationship compared to composition, as the contained objects can outlive the containing object.\n\n\nThe problem statement for aggregation and composition in java can be found here."

It manages the data, handles database interactions, and performs operations independent of the user interface. Changes in the Model often notify the View to update itself.\nView: Responsible for the presentation layer. It displays data from the Model to the user and sends user inputs to the Controller. The View is concerned with how the data is represented but doesn’t handle any business logic.\nController: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user inputs from the View, updates the Model accordingly, and may trigger changes in the View. The Controller directs the flow of the application based on user interactions.\n\nIn Java, the MVC pattern is widely used in frameworks like Spring MVC and JavaFX to build web and desktop applications. The key advantage of MVC is that it promotes a clear separation of concerns, which enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability of the code.\n\nThe required mini project for the course that uses MVC can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Link\n\n\n\nThe source code for the project can be found here."

The data will be stored using file storage and the image of PostgreSQL pulled from Docker will also be used for storage.\nThe subsequent business logic layer accommodates administrative microservices essential for the seamless functioning of the platform. These microservices facilitate data management and execute pivotal tasks to ensure the platform’s consistent operation. Additionally, the layer is fortified by encryption algorithms, which not only enhance data security but also adhere to fundamental encryption principles.\nThe final presentation layer, the third tier, acts as the interface connecting the system to its users. Through well-designed APIs and a web browser interface, legal practitioners gain access to the suite of tools and functionalities offered by our cloud-based management system. This user-centric approach not only enhances user experience but also empowers legal professionals to leverage technology optimally in their practices.\nView Source Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject paper\n\n\n\nThe final paper for the project can be found here."

These will form the nodes of the social graph.\n\n\nExtract a Social Graph of the Manually Identified Characters in the Text\nAfter identifying the characters, the next step is to extract their interactions from the text. In a social graph: - Nodes: Represent the characters. - Edges: Represent interactions or relationships between characters (e.g., dialogues, mentions, or encounters in the book). - Edge Weights: Could be added to represent the strength of interactions (e.g., frequency of communication, intensity of the relationship). - The resulting social graph can be represented as an adjacency matrix or an edge list.\n\n\nCalculate the Four Types of Centrality of Main Protagonists\nOnce the social graph is built, use centrality measures to determine which characters are most “central” or influential within the network:\n\nDegree Centrality: Measures the number of direct connections a character has. Characters with high degree centrality are involved with many others.\nBetweenness Centrality: Measures the extent to which a character lies on the shortest paths between others. Characters with high betweenness centrality act as “bridges” in the network.\nCloseness Centrality: Measures how close a character is to all other characters in terms of shortest paths. Characters with high closeness centrality can reach others in fewer steps.\nPageRank: Based on the Google PageRank algorithm, this centrality takes into account not just the number of connections a character has but also the importance of the characters they are connected to.\n\n\n\nDetect Communities\nCommunity detection involves finding clusters of characters that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. Algorithms like Louvain or Girvan-Newman can be used to automatically detect these communities.\n\n\nCreate Equivalent Generative Models to Compare Against the Social Graph\nTo understand whether the social graph extracted from the novel reflects typical social patterns or is unique to the story, models like Erdős-Rényi (Random Graph), Barabási-Albert (Scale-Free Network), and Watts-Strogatz (Small-World Network) can be used.\nView Source Code"

Identifying the Need for Redesign\n\nOutdated Design: The existing design no longer reflected the company’s brand identity or current web trends.\nPoor User Experience (UX): Users reported difficulty navigating the site, finding relevant information, and interacting with key features.\nMobile Responsiveness Issues: The site was not fully optimized for mobile devices, resulting in high bounce rates from mobile users.\n\n\n\n2. Defining Project Goals\n\nImproved UX/UI Design: Create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface to enhance the overall user experience.\nMobile Optimization: Ensure the site is fully responsive and accessible on all devices, including smartphones and tablets.\nStreamlined Content Structure: Organize content in a way that makes it easy to navigate, improving accessibility to important information.\nPerformance Optimization: Reduce load times and improve site speed for better SEO and user retention.\nModernization and Brand Alignment: Align the site’s design with current brand guidelines and industry standards, presenting a fresh, modern look.\n\n\n\n3. Research and Analysis\nThe redesign started with a comprehensive analysis of the existing site. This included:\n\nUser Feedback: Conducting surveys and analyzing user behavior data to identify pain points.\nCompetitor Analysis: Studying competitors’ websites to gain insights into best practices and industry standards.\nPerformance Audits: Using tools like Google Analytics to assess the site’s performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n4.Information Architecture (IA) and Wireframing\nBased on the research, the next step was to rethink the structure of the site:\n\nSite Mapping: The creation of a clear and concise sitemap to define how users will navigate the site.\nWireframes: Developing wireframes for key pages to outline the layout, structure, and placement of elements such as navigation menus, content sections, and CTAs (Call to Actions).\n\n\n\n5. Design and Development\nOnce the wireframes were approved, the design phase began:\n\nUI/UX Design: Incorporating modern design trends, such as flat design, minimalism, and ample whitespace to improve readability. The color scheme and typography were also updated to reflect the brand’s personality.\nMobile-First Design: Adopting a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the site was designed with mobile users in mind from the outset.\nInteractive Elements: Adding interactive elements like sliders, hover effects, and animations to enhance engagement and provide visual feedback to users."
